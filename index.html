[Intro]
DY Krazy
It's been a long

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
I been road running, rocking shows, stunting
Smoking on Runtz and, codeine for lunch and
Yeah, I poured a four with a red on my luncheon, yeah
I got bored, let the dragons out my dungeon, yeah
Mixing pills, watch them stir up in my stomach, yeah
Give her pipe, pipe, pipe, I'm a plumber, yeah
Pockets Jim Carrey, going Dumb and Dumber in here

[Verse 1]
I'm going crazy for your love, I ain't talkin' 'bout a girl
No, I'm talkin' 'bout the drugs, uh-huh
I'm going crazy for your love
Not about the girl, it's 'bout the drugs
Plug on my phone, I love to pick up (Okay)
I nickname my plug, "Day Maker" (Okay)
I nickname these drugs, "Life-takers"
Dream-takers (Uh), I'm a dream chaser (Uh-huh)
Wake up, gripping styrofoam
Lost inside my mind, yeah, I'm looking for a home (Home)
Off of these Percocets in the underworld, I roam (Roam)
I don't know where to go (Oh), I must get high, that's for sure

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
I been road running, rocking shows, stunting
Smoking on Runtz and, codeine for lunch and
Yeah, I poured a four with a red on my luncheon, yeah
I got bored, let the dragons out my dungeon, yeah
Mixing pills, watch them stir up in my stomach, yeah
Give her pipe, pipe, pipe, I'm a plumber, yeah
Pockets Jim Carrey, going Dumb and Dumber in here

[Verse 2]
Pockets on Jim Carrey going dumber and dumber (Okay)
I feel like I'm Nick Cannon the way that I'm drumming (Okay)
I feel like I got an extra finger or somethin' (Let's go)
All these hunnids I'm thumbing (Let's go)
All these hunnids I'm thumbing through (Let's go)
Hit her from the back 'til she scream, ooh, woah
R.I.P to Nipsey, he was leaving Blue's Clues (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Red bottom, super bloody, Piru shoes (Slatt, slatt)
Step on his head in the night, yeah (Slatt)
Got the metal like a knight, yeah (Slatt)
Left, right, we could fight, yeah (Slatt)
Codeine with the Sprite, yeah (Slatt)
Bodeine with the Sprite, yeah (Slatt)
I pull up to your block, we shooting out the rear (Okay)
Like LeBron, I'm fuckin' ballin', cavalier (Okay)
I'm a vampire, Buffy isn't welcome here
The end is near, ayy
Um, buried alive, my right is left, my left is right
I fucked your bitch and left her, right
Back at the motel, had a hell of a night
I'm in the sky like an eagle, eagle
Even though a nigga pelican fly
I remember they was doubtin' us
They ain't know I had my eyes on the prize
In the studio, sippin' codeine all night
Caught a fuck-nigga slipping, I put him on ice
Shoot the brain out his head and then I leave him to die
I just gave his mom a reason to cry
I'm a real ass nigga, don't believe in the lies
Please don't look me in my eyes
If you could see the pain inside, leave a nigga terrified
[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
I been road running, rocking shows, stunting
Smoking on Runtz and, codeine for lunch and
Yeah, I poured a four with a red on my luncheon, yeah
I got bored, let the dragons out my dungeon, yeah
Mixing pills, watch them stir up in my stomach, yeah
Give her pipe, pipe, pipe, I'm a plumber, yeah
